Abstract of the code:
The provided code is a FastAPI application that serves an endpoint to generate and return images based on a given prompt using the Stable Diffusion model. It utilizes the `diffusers` library, which is a deep learning-based text-to-image generation framework. The application uses the FastAPI framework to handle HTTP requests and responses, and the PIL library to work with images.

Step-by-step method to use the API:

1. Install Dependencies:
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required dependencies by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn pillow diffusers
   ```

2. Save the Code:
   Copy the provided code and save it into a Python script, e.g., `main.py`.

3. Run the API Server:
   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` script, and run the following command to start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000`.

4. Access the API Documentation:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/docs`. This will open the Swagger UI, where you can explore the available endpoints, input parameters, and responses. Alternatively, you can use `http://localhost:8000/redoc` to access the ReDoc UI, which provides a more user-friendly interface.

5. Use the API to Generate Images:
   Now that the server is running, you can use the API to generate images based on prompts.

   - To generate an image with the default prompt ("a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"), you can simply access the `/image/` endpoint through your web browser or any HTTP client like `curl`.
     Example URL: `http://localhost:8000/image/`

   - To generate an image with a custom prompt, you can specify the `prompt` query parameter in the URL. The prompt should be URL-encoded. Replace `<your-custom-prompt>` with your desired prompt.
     Example URL: `http://localhost:8000/image/?prompt=<your-custom-prompt>`

6. Save and Reuse Generated Images:
   The API is designed to save the generated images in the "images" folder. The images are saved with filenames based on the cleaned version of the prompt (stripping out special characters and converting to lowercase). If an image already exists for a specific prompt, the API will return the previously generated image without re-generating it. This ensures that you can retrieve and reuse previously generated images efficiently.

Please note that the code assumes you have access to the `diffusers` library, specifically the Stable Diffusion model (`"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1"`). If you encounter any issues with the dependencies or model, make sure they are correctly installed and accessible in your Python environment.

Remember to modify the hostname and port if you run the server on a different address. Additionally, for a production environment, consider configuring the server accordingly and using appropriate security measures as needed.
